# Wildcat-Voices

## Description
CS 499 Senior Project for the University of Kentucky. The Wildcat Voices project aims to predict the location of a speaker, given short audio samples.

## Running Unit Tests
We use the unittest library that comes with Python for unit testing. You can run the command:   
`python -m unittest discover`
